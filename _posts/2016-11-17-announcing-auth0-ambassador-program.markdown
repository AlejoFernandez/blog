##Background
Here at Auth0 our core mission is to make the internet safer. We do this by serving the developer community and giving them the tools they need for their applications to be secure and successful. 

However our service to the dev community doesn't end there. We regularly give [conference talks](https://t.co/BpponhTwXI), [create technical content](https://auth0.com/blog/tags/featured/), [release open source libraries](https://auth0.com/opensource) and more. With the Auth0 [Ambassador program](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program) we're looking to expand on these outreach efforts.


### What does the program entail ?

As an Auth0 Ambassador, our evangelism team will help you build up your brand and local developer community by:

+ Giving you opportunities to mentor developers at startup accelerators, hackathons & conferences
+ Helping you organize local meetups. Provide swag and sponsorship. 
+ Building up your technical speaking and writing skills.
+ Helping you find and create open source projects that you can get involved in.
+ Showcasing the awesome hacks you build ontop of our APIs
+ & more! 

Everything is on a voluntary basis. You can do as much or as little as your schedule permits. However the more you do, the more rewards and perks you get! 

### Who can apply ?  

Our passion is to make developers lives more awesome. We're looking for developers who feel the same way. You naturally get satisfaction and enjoyment when you teach or solve problems for others. To see our other criteria check out our [Ambassador Program page](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program). 

### Rewards and Perks

This is not a paid position but our evangelism team setup the program so the more developers you serve the more perks you can attain. For a detailed list visit our [Ambassador Page](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program). Some of the perks are:

+ We'll pay for travel and lodging to any of your accepted talks that cover Auth0 or Identity/Security
