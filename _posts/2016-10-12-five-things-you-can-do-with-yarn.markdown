**TL;DR:** There are several package managers in the JavaScript land: **npm**, **bower**, **component**, **volo**. As of this writing, the most popular package manager in the JavaScript land is **npm**. The npm client provides access to hundreds of thousands of code libraries in the npm registry. Just recently, facebook launched a new package manager for JavaScript called **Yarn** which claims to be faster, more reliable and secure than the already existing npm client. In this article, you will learn how five things you can do with Yarn.

**Yarn** is a new package manager for JavaScript created by facebook. It offers a fast, highly reliable and secure dependency management for developers using JavaScript in their apps. Here are five things you can do with Yarn.

## 1. Work Offline

Yarn offers you the ability to work in offline mode. If you have installed a package before, you can install it again without having any internet connection. A typical example is shown below:

When connected to the internet, I installed two packages with Yarn like so:

_Create a package.json with yarn init_

_Install express and jsonwebtoken packages with yarn_

_Installation complete_

After the installation was complete, I went ahead to delete the *node_modules* inside my *orijin* directory and also disconnected from the internet.

Disconnected from the internet, I ran Yarn like so again:

_Yarn installed the packages offline_

Viola!, all the packages were installed again in less than two seconds. Apparently, Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to again. It also maximizes resource utilization by parallelizing operations so that install times are faster than ever.

## 2. Install From Multiple Registries

Yarn offers you the ability to install JavaScript packages from multiple registries such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [bower](https://bower.io/), your git repository and even your local file system.

By default, it scans the npm registry for your package like so:

```bash
yarn add <pkg-name>
```

Install a package from a remote gzipped tarball like so:

```bash
yarn add <https://thatproject.code/package.tgz>
```

Install a package from your local file system like so:

```bash
yarn add file:/path/to/local/folder
```

This is particularly helpful for developers that constantly publish JavaScript packages. You can always use this to test out your packages before publishing it to a registry.

Install a package from a remote git repository like so:

```bash
yarn add <git remote-url>
```

_Yarn also automatically detects that the git repo exists as a package in the bower registry and treats it as such_

## 3. Fetch Packages Speedily

If you have used **npm** for a while, you must have had experiences where you had to run `npm install`, then go watch a movie and come back to check if all the packages you required are done installing. Well, maybe not that long, but it takes a lot of time to traverse the dependency tree and pull dependencies in. With Yarn, installation time has really been cut down from having to wait several minutes to package installs happening in seconds.

Yarn efficiently queues up requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization. It starts by making requests to the registry and recursively looking up each dependency. Next, it looks in a global cache directory to see if the package has been downloaded before. If it hasn't, Yarn fetches the package tarball and places it in the global cache to enable it work offline and eliminate the need to re-download.

During install, Yarn parallelizes operations which makes the install process faster. I did a fresh install of three packages namely, **jsonwebtoken**, **express** and **lodash** using **npm** and **yarn**. By the time *Yarn* was done installing them, *npm* was still installing.

## 4. Lock Package Versions Automatically

Npm has a feature called **shrinkwrap** which is intended to lock down your package dependencies for production use. The challenge with **shrinkwrap** is that every developer has to manually run `npm shrinkwrap` to generate the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file. Developers are also humans, we can forget!

With Yarn, it's a different ball game. From installation, a `yarn.lock` file is generated automatically. It is similar to the `composer.lock` file that PHP developers are familiar with. The `yarn.lock` file locks down the exact versions of the packages that have been installed and all its dependencies. With this file, you can be certain that every member of your engineering team have the exact package versions installed and deployments can easily be reproduced without unexpected bugs.

## 5. Install Dependencies Same Way Across Machines

The **npm client** installs dependencies in a way that can make the structure of the contents of *Developer A* `node_modules` directory different from *Developer B*. It uses a non-deterministic approach to install those package dependencies. This approach is sometimes responsible for bugs that can't be easily reproduced because of the popular *works on my system* problem.

With Yarn, the presence of a lock file and an install algorithm ensures that the dependencies installed produce the exact same file and folder structure across machines.


## Conclusion

Yarn at its infancy has already brought significant improvements with the way JavaScript packages are fetched from global registries into local environments especially with regards to speed and security. Will it grow to become the most popular choice amongst JavaScript developers? Have you switched yet? What are your thoughts about Yarn? Let me know in the comments section! ðŸ˜Š
