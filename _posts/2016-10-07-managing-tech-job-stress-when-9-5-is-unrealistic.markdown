**TL;DR** Many jobs in the tech industry are fast-paced, stimulating, rewardingâ€”and notorious for being stressful. The key to managing stress and burnout is to realize that we have more control than we think regarding the way we work, interact with the people around us, and engage in self-care. We'll consider a plethora of ways we can cope with job-induced stress both in the workplace and at home.

## When the Obvious Answers are Unrealistic

Consider a hypothetical scenario: your current project is under pressure to meet a seemingly unattainable deadline. Your entire team is working nights and weekends. The delivery date is immovable and there's no more scope to cut. You've looked for help managing stress and have read you should "go home at five no matter what" and "refuse to work Saturdays". 

This is sound advice, but right now it seems idealistic to the point of impossible. You feel obligated to do whatever it takes to complete the project on time, including working long hours and giving up weekends. Maybe you love your job, even if it's stressful. You normally enjoy the fast pace, but you're getting burned out. The situation feels out of your control. What can you do?

A perception of lack of control makes a high-pressure situation feel even more stressful. However, there are things we can do to alleviate this. We'll go over suggestions aggregated by consulting communities of devoted tech employees in a variety of positions, including engineers, system administrators, project managers, engineering managers, quality assurance engineers, user experience architects, and more.

## Coping with Work Stress: At Work

There is no magic bullet for work stress or burnout. You might get a hundred professional massages (but seriously, who has the time?) and not feel much better. The first place to tackle work stress is _at work_.

### Be the Canary in the Coal Mine

Let's start at the beginning. After all, every situation has one: a point when we first sense things are going to become painful. If we're lucky enough to be present at that time, we should _not_ stand idly by. And even if we come aboard after the ship has set sail, we shouldn't simply remain silent through the storm.

[Dave Winkel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-winkel-b9438a) emphasizes the importance of being "[the canary in the coal mine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine)". **Raising red flags early and often helps us steer a situation.** [Laura Kimpel-Matthews](http://twitter.com/ellekayemme) recommends **escalating with solutions for upper management** and including all potential options to open a discussion. Suggest cutting scope, increasing resources, extending timelines, shifting responsibilities, etc. It's very difficult to ignore a well-crafted proposal for improvement and good management should be willing to work with our suggestions. 

### We're All in This Together Now

**Remember that our teammates are experiencing the same situation.** We're all in this together. It's easy to accidentally cultivate a toxic atmosphere when everyone is stressed and overworked. [Emily Gladstone Cole](http://twitter.com/unixgeekem) emphasizes that we "need to help foster a culture of supporting each other. Answer each other's questions, don't be negative about someone, and be as impersonal as possible when raising concerns on their work."

**Do things as a team.** Take twenty minutes to go out for gelato together. If everyone is working late, expense dinner and eat together (_not_ at desks!) while having a lively discussion about anything _except_ our stressful project. [Mike Behnke](http://twitter.com/localpcguy) recommends "tracking wins" and sharing them: any positive feedback received from clients, management, or peers can help bolster the team.

### Take Breaks and Recognize When to Rest

It's easy to feel like we need to keep our eyes glued to our monitors to meet a deliverable, but **getting away helps keep us sane _and_ productive**. We need to set and know our limits and go home when we've hit them. [Ado Kukic](http://twitter.com/kukicado) makes the important point that "being constantly on edge and stressed greatly decreases the quality of output, which only ends up in working even longer hours to fix an already crumbling deliverable." 

**Don't eat lunch in front of a computer or at a desk.** Get food elsewhere with friends / coworkers if possible. This provides a much needed mental reset partway through the day.

**Get up and walk around.** A short trek to the break room for coffee, a chat around the water jug, a brisk walk around the parking lot, any movement and small change of scenery keeps our bodies more active and our minds more alert. This doesn't need to be time-consuming or disruptive. Five to fifteen minutes taken periodically throughout the day helps far more than it harms a busy schedule.

Even if we aren't in a position to take time off right now, [Steve Pheley](http://twitter.com/spheley) encourages us to **negotiate some much-needed vacation in the near future**. This will hopefully afford some valuable recovery time. Also, don't cancel pre-planned vacations even if they conflict with the project schedule. If our vacation was on the books and approved a long time ago, we shouldn't forgo it to stay and work. Time off is an employee's right and sacrificing it only makes us resentful.

### Leaner Workflow and Work Style

Scrutinize the distribution of work. **If there's a way to make more efficient use of resources, do so.** Sometimes it's difficult to delegate when everyone appears to be under equal stress, but [Mike](http://twitter.com/localpcguy) reminds us there are often valid ways to unburden individuals. 

[Karen Ford](http://twitter.com/karenforda2) reminds us to **ask "am I really needed here?" when being invited to meetings or included on email chains**. Managers and senior level employees spend a substantial amount of time in meetings, occasionally standing on ceremony rather than out of necessity. We can also make it clear that we'll respond to emails at certain times of day but instanteous feedback shouldn't be expected. Then we can gain some uninterrupted productivity.

**Ask for help.** [Maitland Hemby](http://twitter.com/androidqueen) offers an excellent tech employee serenity prayer: "Grant me the patience to figure stuff out when I can, the courage to ask for help when I can't, and the wisdom to know the difference." When we have the luxury of time we spend many, many hours Googling things. When we're under the pressure of a deliverable or drowning in an ocean of tasks, we should ask for help. The people around us at work are a fount of valuable knowledge.

**Break tasks into bite-sized pieces and keep lists.** [Karen](http://twitter.com/karenforda2) promotes breaking down large tasks into smaller, more digestible ones. The benefits are twofold: this "helps you keep sane of your goals and helps you feel more accomplished at the end of the day because you can cross things off your list." That sense of achievement at the end of any single day is an important indicator that progress is being made.

### Communication and Support From Management

Potentially the most effective way to manage workplace stress is to have a channel of communication with our bosses that produces positive outcomes. This can also be the most challenging. Sometimes pushing back yields good--or at least encouraging--results, and sometimes it's entirely unsuccessful.
