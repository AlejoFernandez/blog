**TL;DR** Many jobs in the tech industry are fast-paced, stimulating, rewardingâ€”and notorious for being stressful. The key to managing stress and burnout is to realize that we have more control than we think regarding the way we work, interact with the people around us, and engage in self-care. We'll consider a plethora of ways we can cope with job-induced stress both in the workplace and at home.

## When the Obvious Answers are Unrealistic

Consider a hypothetical scenario: your current project is under pressure to meet a seemingly unattainable deadline. Your entire team is working nights and weekends. The delivery date is immovable and there's no more scope to cut. You've looked for help managing stress and have read you should "go home at five no matter what" and "refuse to work Saturdays". 

This is sound advice, but right now it seems idealistic to the point of impossible. You feel obligated to do whatever it takes to complete the project on time, including working long hours and giving up weekends. Maybe you love your job, even if it's stressful. You normally enjoy the fast pace, but you're getting burned out. The situation feels out of your control. What can you do?

A perception of lack of control makes a high-pressure situation feel even more stressful. However, there are things we can do to alleviate this. We'll go over suggestions aggregated by consulting communities of devoted tech employees in a variety of positions, including engineers, system administrators, project managers, engineering managers, quality assurance engineers, user experience architects, and more.

## Coping with Work Stress: At Work

There is no magic bullet for work stress or burnout. You might get a hundred professional massages (but seriously, who has the time?) and not feel much better. The first place to tackle work stress is _at work_.

### Be the Canary in the Coal Mine

Let's start at the beginning. After all, every situation has one: a point when we first sense things are going to become painful. If we're lucky enough to be present at that time and recognize the warning signs, we should _not_ stand idly by. And even if we come aboard after the ship has set sail, we shouldn't simply remain silent through the storm.

[Dave Winkel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-winkel-b9438a) emphasizes the importance of being "[the canary in the coal mine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine)". **Raising red flags early and often helps us get ahead of a situation.** [Laura Kimpel-Matthews](http://twitter.com/ellekayemme) recommends **escalating with solutions for upper management** and including all potential options to open a discussion. Suggest cutting scope, increasing resources, extending timelines, shifting responsibilities, etc. It's very difficult to ignore a well-crafted proposal for improvement and good management should be willing to work with us. 

### We're All in This Together Now

**Remember that our teammates are experiencing the same situation.** We're all in this together. It's easy to accidentally cultivate a toxic atmosphere when everyone is stressed and overworked. [Emily Gladstone Cole](http://twitter.com/unixgeekem) emphasizes that we "need to help foster a culture of supporting each other. Answer each other's questions, don't be negative about someone, and be as impersonal as possible when raising concerns on their work."

**Do things as a team.** Take twenty minutes to out for gelato together. If everyone is working late, we should expense dinner and eat together (_not_ at our desks!) while having a lively discussion about anything _except_ our stressful project. [Mike Behnke](http://twitter.com/localpcguy) recommends tracking "wins" and sharing them: any positive feedback received from clients, management, or peers can help bolster the team.

### Take Breaks

It's easy to feel like we need to keep our eyes glued to our monitors to get things done, but the truth is that getting away helps keep us sane _and_ productive.
